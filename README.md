# swipe-documentation

Currently there is only documentation for swipe in Russian. This repository will give birth an English translation of swipe. This is my first open source project! Stoked to help out some folx far away and learn a thing or two in the process about documentation.

## What is Swipe?

Swipe is a code generation tool that automates the creation of repetitively used code. Configuration parameters are presented in Swipe as parameters of the Golang function, using explicit initialization instead of global variables or reflections.
